MODULE 6

## Project 6
 
In this module, you'll complete a guided exploratory data analysis project, then conduct a second, unique data analysis/exploration project. the goal is to tell an unique and compelling story with data. Not just your analytical compatibilities, but your ability to communicate in a professional and engaging manner is key. 

# Task 2 - Diamonds Dataset
1.	Follow the instructions for Exercise 9.16 (starting pg. 350).
2.	Complete the exercise in a notebook. 
3.	1-Load: Get the file, store it in your repo, and load it into a DataFrame. 
4.	2-View: Display the first 7 rows and the last 7 rows.
5.	3-Describe: Use the DataFrame describe() function to calculate basic descriptive statistics for all numeric columns. 
6.	4-Series: Use the Series method describe() to calculate the descriptive stats for all category/text columns.
7.	4-Unique: Use the Series method unique() to get unique category values. 
8.	5-Histograms: Use the DataFrame's hist() function to create a histogram for each numerical column.
9.	Required: Use Section headings in your Markdown to make it clear that each of these sections are shown in your notebook. They should be numbered 1-5 and include the keyword shown above.
10.	Required: Include the title of the notebook, and your name and date at the top.
11.	Do these consistently. A heading and section titles is required in every notebook. 

# Task 3 - Exploratory Data Project
1.	Use everything you've learned to conduct a unique data exploration project using some information related to your domain. 
2.	Tell a story with data (do a web search to learn more).
3.	Use this project to feature all of the key skills learned - creating a professional notebook, writing a good README.md (do a web search). 
4.	Include challenging Python programming aspects - find a reason to use filter(), map(), and list comprehensions.
5.	Have fun and make it unique.
